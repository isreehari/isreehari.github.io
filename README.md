Project 2 is a group (3 or 4 students) project (assigned here). A leader is also selected by the instructor. In this project, students will work on the texts extracted from news/blogs and classified into 4 categories: people names, locations, organizations, and miscellaneous. Each entry also contains the published time/date of the article/blog. Students are provided 2 datasets: The Wikinews data (roughly 3.3M) contains 11,267 articles and the Huffington Post data (roughly 29.4M) contains 75,293 political blogs. Students are required to demonstrate their web applications on both datasets.
